   -> In hourly Sales data Most profitable hours (both 2020 and 2021) are 16:00 and 17:00 

   -> In Registered Category Profit is much higher than Casual Category

   -> Price has increased by 25% in 2022 ðŸ’¹

   -> Rider difference by year is 64% ðŸ’¹

   -> Even though price increased still managed to get 64% demand
